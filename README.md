# Hi, i'm pqba

I build apps on the web, am study computer science and cognitive science in university, and 

Currenty exploring:
- Neural networks which simulate memory degeneration
- A web app leveraging generative AI which builds unique stories based on multimodal data

I've worked on:
- A complex number library in C++ with Catch2 test integration
- A minimalist, pastel colored Reddit app built with Flask (Python)
- Network infrastructure, VMWare and IT device imaging through an internship
- A steampunk brick breaker game build for Android built in Java
